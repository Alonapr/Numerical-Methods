In the lab_1 program finds the largest root of the nonlinear equation.
Lab_2: solving systems of linear algebraic equations by Seidel's iterative method and Gauss's direct method, 
where the search for the main element takes place over the entire matrix.
Lab_3: finding the maximum and minimum eigenvalues of a matrix by the power method.
Lab_4: realisation of Lagrange interpolation polynomial and Newton's interpolating polynomial, the result demonstrates also on graph.
