# Numerical Methods – Lab Projects  
**National Taras Shevchenko University of Kyiv**

This repository contains 4 laboratory works completed as part of the **Numerical Methods** course. Each lab focuses on a different numerical technique and is implemented in Python.

## Overview of Labs

### Lab 1
- Implements a method to find the **largest root** of a given nonlinear equation.

### Lab 2
- Solves systems of linear algebraic equations using:
  - **Seidel’s iterative method**
  - **Gaussian elimination** with **full pivoting** (pivot search across the entire matrix)

### Lab 3
- Finds the **maximum and minimum eigenvalues** of a matrix using the **power method**.

### Lab 4 
- Implements:
  - **Lagrange interpolation polynomial**
  - **Newton's interpolation polynomial**
- Visualizes the interpolation results on a graph for better comparison.
